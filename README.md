## Goal
Produce a .DLL that players can use to write native Unreal Engine modifications for [Deep Rock Galactic](https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/).

## Non-goals

* No Rust standard library (enforced through `#[no_std]`)
* No third-party crate dependencies
* No heap allocations
* No panic branches (enforced through unlinkable panic_handler)
